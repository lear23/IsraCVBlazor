    "web_consultant_description": "I have just completed the new website for Neoleaf, where I had the freedom to work quite independently. The only requirement was to use Piranha CMS, but I also chose to work with Blazor components in Piranha CMS. This allowed me to create my own boilerplate for the project (almost finished, just a few details left before we can deploy the site). After that, I will tackle the Cobino website. The plan is to use Piranha CMS as a headless CMS and build the frontend with React. During my time here, I have also learned a lot about Azure, DevOps, and how to use Docker in projects.",
